Browse a large strategy library and quickly find what you need with search, table minimum filters, and buy-in filters. Open any strategy to review clearly structured content with headings, notes, credit, and step-by-step instructions.

Create your own strategies in the app, then save, edit, duplicate, delete, and resubmit them whenever you want. Share both built-in and user-created strategies using the native Android share sheet with plain text output.
